# Delete a replicaset and all its Pods
kubectl delete pods --all
#   This will delete replicaset and all Pods governed by it
kubectl delete rs/frontend-replicaset-example

# Delete just a ReplicaSet but not its Pods
kubectl delete rs/frontend-replicaset-example --cascade=false
    # This will orphan its Pods and are now vulnerable to crash
    # you can create a new ReplicaSet with same labels as pervious. 
    #   This new replicaset will adopt Pods from older replicaset.

# Isolating Pods from the ReplicaSet
#   just change the selector from the ReplicaSet spec. 
#   After edit, the pod will no longer be part of the Replicaset as the selector spec of the replicaset doesn't match the Pod's new labels. 
#   To maintain the Desired state i.e. defined by 'replicas' spec, the ReplicaSet will fire another Pod. 

# Scale a ReplicaSet
#   Just update the replicas spec in the yaml file and apply this change
#   This is not auto scaling as you have manually changed the replicas config.


# auto-scaling using replicaset (using HorizontalPodAutoscaler)
#   specify target replicaset
